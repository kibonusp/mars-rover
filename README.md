## About
Mars Rover is a website that allows users to set a grid size in which a rover could move according to user's instructions.

The possible instructions are:
 * L: turn anticlockwise;
 * R: turn clockwise;
 * M: move forward
 
User is also able to set the rover's start position, such as 1 2 N, where 1 is the x index, 2 is the y index and N is the direction.

Possible directions are:

 * N: North;
 * E: East;
 * S: South;
 * W: West
 
The position index is 0-based. Therefore, 0 0 is the upper-left coordinate.
